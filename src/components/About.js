          ADVAITA is the annual Techno-Cult fest of IIIT Bhubaneswar. It was
          named “ADVAITA”, meaning “non-duality”, which was the intention, to
          fuse both technology and culture into one. Past years has seen a
          mercurial rise in the fest, expanding and establishing itself as one
          of the biggest and the most anticipated events in the state of Odisha.
